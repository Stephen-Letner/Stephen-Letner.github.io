   <li>Universal Studios</li>
      -No trip to Orlando is complete without a day spent in Hogwarts or Hogsmeade!<p>
   <li>Pigeon Forge, TN</li>
      -This is where we encoutered our first MagiQuest&reg;!<p>
   <li>Disneyland</li>
      -If you've gone to Disney World, then you have to go Disneyland at some point!<p>
