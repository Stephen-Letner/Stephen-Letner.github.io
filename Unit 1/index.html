<h3>History</h3>
<hr>
<p>Who is <b>mewithoutYou</b>? They are a band from Philadelphia, PA which have a unique sound. They began when Aaron Weiss, the bassist of a band called <b>The Operation</b>, wanted to experiment with some new sounds. In the metal/hardcore genre most bands' vocalists do a type of screaming, but Aaron's style is more of a talking/spoken word kind of yelling. While in <b>The Operation</b> Aaron had written some lyrics that were very poetic and wanted to try doing something with them so he switched over to lead vocals and the then lead vocalist, Greg Jehanian, eventually switched over to bass and that is how <b>mewithoutYou</b> was born.</p>

<h3>Style Changes</h3>
<hr>
<p>Over the years <b>mewithoutYou</b> have changed styles musically several times. <i>[A-->B] Life</i>, their first album, was very heavy with lots of distorted guitars backing Aaron's unique vocal voicings. As each album was released, their style became more and more subdued, even including normal singing and harmonies with very upbeat and happy tunes about anthropmorhic plants and animals. For a band that's been around for 22 years now, they have gotten very good at reinventing themselves with each new album and always keep the listener guessing what new sounds they will come up with each time.</p>

<h3>Personal Experiences</h3>
<hr>
<p>When I was around 21 years old, I was getting into heavier music and one day while I was listening to a new hardcore band from Douglasville, GA named <b>Norma Jean</b>, I heard a second vocalist at the end of the song <i>Memphis Will Be Laid to Waste</i>. The singular sound of his voice led me to wanting to find out who he was. I soon discovered that he had also written his part of the lyrics in that song, and I really liked the style. This led me to finding out that he was the lead vocalist of a band called <b>mewithoutYou</b> and they quickly became one of my new favorite bands. Over the years I have gone to see them in concert over a dozen times (maybe more than that!). My wife is also a fan and we always see them together. One time that I recall very fondly was when I lived in Urbana, IL and they played at the IMC (an old post office building converted into a concert venue). We took a friend of mine from work with us who was quite a bit older than us and whose favorite band is <b>KISS</b>. Needless to say, he was not very impressed by them, and would always give me a hard time about it afterward. We still had a great time regardless and were so excited that they were playing in our own town! Another time, after they released <i>It's All Crazy!</i>, I even took my Dad to see them! He kind of liked their more subdued musical style and somehow I convinced him to go with me. The last time that I saw them was a couple of weeks ago on May 28th in St. Louis MO at Red Flag.</p>

<h3>A Fond "Farewell"?</h3>
<hr>
<p>The band originally announced that 2020 would be their final year as an active band, but due to the pandemic they had to postpone their final tour. After a two year hiatus, they are finally playing that tour and have called it their "Farewell" tour. The poster for the tour shows a graphic of a tree stump with a small twig growing behind it, so it could possibly be hinting that this won't be the end of their music making entirely. In fact, since they have many religious concepts in their songs, it points to a verse in the Bible from Job chapter 14, verse 7 which states, "For there is hope for a tree, When it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And its shoots will not fail. (NASB)". So will this be their final tour, or does the tour poster hint that they will they eventually put out new music again someday? Only time will tell, but you can bet whenever they do, I'll be here for it!</p>
